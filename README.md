# Dapur Mama Megumi
The Dapur Mama Megumi website is an online platform showcasing a home-cooked catering service. It features a detailed menu and about us section. The site aims to provide users with an easy way to explore the offerings and learn about the brandâ€™s story. 

# Features
- Navbar: allow user to navigate to different section of the website. I have link the About Us menu at the Navbar to the About Us session at the bottom part of the website. There is also a search button function but for now it is not functional.
- Card: I used this function to create individual menu with a detail description and picture of the dishes. The picture is given 0.5rem padding to make it display nicely in the centre
- Responsive Design: Compatible with various devices and screen sizes.
- About Us Section: Provides information about the catering service
